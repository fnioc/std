// The plugin-less wiring + entry point.
//
// This is the SAME app as ../../with-transformer, wired by hand. It imports the
// IDENTICAL contracts + service classes from `@rhombus-std/di.examples.shared` (via a
// relative source path, so plain `tsc` compiles them into this example's own
// `dist`). Diff this file against the with-transformer main.ts and the ONLY
// difference is the WIRING STYLE: without the transformer there is no type-driven
// authoring — every registration names an explicit string token, every class
// with ctor dependencies has its signature written by hand (the third `add`
// argument), and open generics are closed manually with `closeToken` / `typeArg`.
//
// Two demos below are the HEADLINE new capabilities this file exists to show off
// (search for "HEADLINE" to find them) — the SAME two with-transformer's sibling
// carries, reproduced through the explicit API:
//   - a `Promise<T>`-only registration + a recursive `resolveAsync` through it.
//   - a class registered AS a factory via a HAND-WRITTEN overload-tuple rest
//     parameter + `Reflect.construct`, proven to resolve identically to
//     registering the class directly. with-transformer derives that rest
//     parameter's type from `OverloadedConstructorParameters<typeof C>` (a
//     transformer-only utility); here it is simply hand-written as the tuple
//     union `[a, b] | [a]`, exactly like every other signature in this file is
//     hand-fed instead of derived.
