# Decisions (v2)

The live record of **owner-ratified** design decisions. Each entry keeps its original `§N`
id so existing `§N` citations across the codebase still resolve here. Entries arrive only two
ways: migrated from the retiring `decisions.md` on explicit owner approval, or recorded fresh
when the owner signals to save one. Kept terse on purpose — this doc is primarily for Claude's
use. Migration rules live in the block at the top of `decisions.md`.

## §79 — Augmentation collision model (delta install + blind prototype merge)

When two augmentation registrations put the same-named member on one class, that's a real
collision. Three parts make it correct-by-construction:

1. **Delta install.** `@augment` installs only each registration's own new members — the first
   application catches up on whatever was already registered, later registrations add only their
   own `set` — so a member reaches a prototype **exactly once**. Delivered via a synchronous
   per-token subscriber list, deliberately NOT an `EventTarget` bus (whose `dispatchEvent`
   swallows a listener's throw, which would silently drop a genuine collision).
2. **Blind merge.** Installing member `n` asks only "is `n` already on the prototype?" Absent →
   mount it. Present → real collision → mount a dispatcher if a `merge` strategy was supplied,
   else **throw** (`augmentation "n" collides on <Class> — supply a merge strategy`). No token /
   receiver / member-identity inspection.
3. **Bag = `Multimap<string, [fn, merge?]>`** per token: each contribution pairs its fn with its
   own strategy; a second same-name registration just appends (the throw lives at install, not
   registration).

Double-installs are harmless by construction (mounted once). No-transformer path: a wrapper
sharing a primitive's name (`log`/`beginScope`, `tryGetValue`, `createLogger`, di's `build`)
supplies a hand-written merge; the convenience form is runtime dot-callable but NOT a typed
overload (TS2430), so the typed path stays the standalone functions. The transformer will later
auto-generate the default merge (deferred). _Owner-approved._

## §47 — Prefer relative internal imports; fall back to the fully-qualified specifier when relative doesn't work

Within a package, internal imports are relative by default. Reach for the fully-qualified package specifier (`@rhombus-std/<pkg>`) only where a relative one won't resolve correctly — the standing case being a `declare module` augmentation target, which must name the package **barrel** so the merge lands on the class every consumer resolves and survives the published `.d.ts`. _Owner-approved._

---

## §72 — Every runtime library is dist-referenced

A library's `.` export resolves its type-facing conditions and `bun` to the rolled `./dist`; none resolve to `./src`. A self-augmenting core resolves its **own** compile back to source through a package-unique `<pkg>-source` custom condition listed first on the `.` export (so it can `declare module` its own barrel before its dist exists). The `./_/*` subpath is the only src-resolving export (§83). _Owner-approved._

---

## §74 — `nameof` and token derivation

`nameof<T>()` is declared in `@rhombus-std/primitives` with a throwing body (a call reaching runtime means the transformer wasn't wired). The transformer lowers it to a token identifying where `T` sits in the exports graph — the package barrel for a publicly-exported type (`pkg:Type`), the `_` subpath for a tests-only one (`pkg/_/file:Type`). It keys on export **membership**, not on-disk path, so a package's own build and an external consumer derive the identical token. _Owner-approved._

---

## §83 — The `_` export is for tests and `nameof` only

Each library's `./_/*` subpath maps to `./src/*` and is publish-scrubbed, so it is reachable by exactly two things: that library's own white-box tests (which import through it), and `nameof`'s token form for a type reachable only through it (`pkg/_/file:Type`, §74). Nothing in shipped code imports through `_`. _Owner-approved._

## §24 — No pluggable containers

di has ONE container type. `build()` accepts a `ServiceProviderFactory` — the type lives in
di.core only so the hosting builders share one shape instead of hand-rolling four copies — but it
IGNORES it: there is nothing to swap. Hosting and everything else must NOT try to support
pluggable or third-party (Autofac-style) containers, and `DefaultServiceProviderFactory` is
deliberately unported. _Owner-decided._

## §84 — Per-builder build-time state rides the builder's `properties` bag

When a hosting-builder augmentation needs to stash state for `build()` to read later (e.g. the
`ServiceProviderOptions` from `useDefaultServiceProvider`), it goes in `IHostBuilder.properties` —
the Map the builder already exposes and threads into the context — under a module-private `Symbol`
key. That bag exists for exactly this per-builder build-time state. (§24: with no pluggable
containers, the factory seam that would otherwise carry these is inert.) _Owner-approved._

## §85 — Keyed services as token-key composition

Keyed services are not a parallel resolution subsystem (the reference bolts on an `IKeyedServiceProvider` hierarchy because its identity is a `Type` object). Our service identity is already a token _string_, so a key is just a suffix on that token: `"<pkg>:<Type>#<key>"`. Registration and resolution of a keyed service therefore need no new engine — a `#`-suffixed token is an ordinary token, resolved by the existing single-arg `resolve(token)` at O(1).

`resolve` gains an optional trailing argument, `key: string | RegExp = ''`:

- an exact `string` (default `''`) → a single service (the non-keyed registration when `''`, else that key); the runtime composes `base + '#' + key` and does an exact lookup.
- a `RegExp` → the list of every registration under `base` whose key-portion matches; a pattern is a plural request, so it returns an array (registration order, per-element lifetime) and never throws on count.

Because "no key" is the empty-string key, the reference's `KeyedService.AnyKey` sentinel disappears: `/.+/` is "any that has a key" (the reference's `AnyKey`), `/.*/` is "true any" (keyed + non-keyed) — a superset the reference cannot express. The `Array<T>` / `Iterable<T>` collection wrappers stay **non-keyed-only** (the reference's `IEnumerable<T>` / `getServices` parity); keyed registrations are reachable only through the key argument, so the two aggregate operations stay disjoint.

The matcher runs against the **key-portion within a fixed base**, never the whole token, so a keyed resolve can never wander into a collection-wrapper token (`Array<pkg:T>`) or another type — the base you name scopes it.

Constructor injection uses a phantom brand, `Keyed<T, K extends string>`, sibling to `Inject`/`Typeof`: the transformer keeps the normal base derivation for `T` and appends `#K`. It stacks with `Inject` as an orthogonal intersection — `Keyed<Inject<T, "tok">, "k">` lowers to `resolve("tok#k")` — because `Inject` sets the base and `Keyed` sets the key. A literal `Keyed<T, "k">` lowers to the pre-composed single-arg form `resolve("<pkg>:<Type>#k")`; the two-arg form is needed only for a `RegExp` or a runtime-dynamic key. Both transformer engines lower it byte-identically.

Deferred: the reference's `FromKeyedServices` `InheritKey` mode (resolve a dependency with the _same_ key that resolved the enclosing service) needs the engine to thread the ambient resolution key through the resolution context — the one keyed feature that is genuine engine work rather than a brand. `ExplicitKey` and `NullKey` modes come for free (`Keyed<T,K>` and plain `T`). The reference descriptor-verb ladder (`addKeyedSingleton`/`tryAddKeyed*`/`removeAllKeyed`/`getKeyedServices`/`isKeyedService`) is likewise deferred — the `#`-token primitive already provides the capability; the sugar verbs are additive and unbuilt.

_Owner-approved._

## §44 — Libraries compile with zero ambient platform types

Every library builds a "bare" program: `types: []` (via `/tsconfig.lib.json`) so no `@types/*`
package auto-injects globals, and a `lib` without `DOM` so no `window`/`fetch`/`document`. The
published `.d.ts` then never leans on `@types/node` or `lib.dom` — an in-repo build sees exactly
what a bare published consumer sees. Platform types come in explicitly instead: `primitives` owns
`process` / timers / streams / `AbortSignal` as typed `globalThis` lookups, and `node:fs` / `node:path`
are typed by per-package `src/node-builtins.d.ts` shims (unimported, so never shipped). Tests,
examples, and repo tooling keep their bun/node types deliberately. _Owner-approved._

## §86 — Browser-host shutdown is a three-tier reliability contract

A browser can discard a page without running async work, so the browser host presents three tiers,
and callers must know which they are relying on:

- **Reliable — `PageLifecycleEvents.onFlush`.** Fires synchronously on every `visibilitychange →
  hidden`, while the page is still alive. Synchronous work here — a `localStorage` write, a
  `navigator.sendBeacon` call — is guaranteed to run (for a beacon: the call fires and enqueues, not
  that delivery arrives). This is the one place to persist critical state; listeners must be
  synchronous.
- **Conditional — a synchronous `applicationStopping` listener.** Runs when a terminal
  (non-persisted) `pagehide` fires, because the abort dispatch is synchronous — but `pagehide` is not
  guaranteed on hard or mobile discard. A backstop, not a guarantee.
- **Best-effort — the async `host.stop()` pipeline** (hosted-service `stop()`/dispose,
  `applicationStopped`). Cut off mid-await on a terminal pagehide and may never start on an abrupt
  discard; reliable only for a deliberate in-app stop, not a page-close-triggered one.

A persisted (bfcache) pagehide never stops the host (suspend≠stop, §69). `sendBeacon` is a plain
global a caller uses inside its own `onFlush`. _Owner-approved._

## §87 — Augmentation authoring stays first-party

Consumers being able to author augmentations is **not** a goal. Consumers authoring
**concretes** that implement an augmented interface **is** a goal — a distinct thing from
authoring the augmentation itself. This ruling drives the scoping of the default-merge-strategy
transformer (#213). _Owner-approved._
