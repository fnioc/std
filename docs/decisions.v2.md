# Decisions (v2)

The live record of **owner-ratified** design decisions. Each entry keeps its original `§N`
id so existing `§N` citations across the codebase still resolve here. Entries arrive only two
ways: migrated from the retiring `decisions.md` on explicit owner approval, or recorded fresh
when the owner signals to save one. Kept terse on purpose — this doc is primarily for Claude's
use. Migration rules live in the block at the top of `decisions.md`.

## §79 — Augmentation collision model (delta install + blind prototype merge)

When two augmentation registrations put the same-named member on one class, that's a real
collision. Three parts make it correct-by-construction:

1. **Delta install.** `@augment` installs only each registration's own new members — the first
   application catches up on whatever was already registered, later registrations add only their
   own `set` — so a member reaches a prototype **exactly once**. Delivered via a synchronous
   per-token subscriber list, deliberately NOT an `EventTarget` bus (whose `dispatchEvent`
   swallows a listener's throw, which would silently drop a genuine collision).
2. **Blind merge.** Installing member `n` asks only "is `n` already on the prototype?" Absent →
   mount it. Present → real collision → mount a dispatcher if a `merge` strategy was supplied,
   else **throw** (`augmentation "n" collides on <Class> — supply a merge strategy`). No token /
   receiver / member-identity inspection.
3. **Bag = `Multimap<string, [fn, merge?]>`** per token: each contribution pairs its fn with its
   own strategy; a second same-name registration just appends (the throw lives at install, not
   registration).

Double-installs are harmless by construction (mounted once). No-transformer path: a wrapper
sharing a primitive's name (`log`/`beginScope`, `tryGetValue`, `createLogger`, di's `build`)
supplies a hand-written merge; the convenience form is runtime dot-callable but NOT a typed
overload (TS2430), so the typed path stays the standalone functions. The transformer will later
auto-generate the default merge (deferred). *Owner-approved.*
