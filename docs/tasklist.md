# Tasklist

Open work items. An item lands here when it is decided but not yet done; it leaves when the change is in.
Architectural rulings belong in `decisions.user.md` (gospel) or `decisions.v2.md` — this file tracks execution only.

## Execution run — 2026-08-19, 22:05

This doc is executed on that date. Everything needed to run it unattended is written here; nothing depends on a
conversation the session cannot read.

**The orchestrator is a CLOUD agent** (owner order 2026-08-20; the local timer launch is deleted). It is
dispatched from the owner's session, runs on Fable, checks this branch out from GitHub, and executes this doc
directly — the `/go`//`/ready` skills do not exist in its environment, so it applies this doc's own gap-handling
rules in their place. It pushes to `IServiceManifest-repair` as work lands (authorized), which is also how the
owner's machine sees progress.

**When the readiness check reports gaps, fix and retry — under two limits.** A gap that is OBVIOUS is auto-fixed
on the spot and `/go` re-run, no asking. Retry ONLY when something concretely changed since the previous attempt:
a file written, a task added, a fix applied. Re-running against an unchanged board is not a retry, and the second
identical verdict is not new information. Five sequential failures halt the run regardless of how much changed
between them.

A gap that is genuinely nuanced — a decision, a reading of intent, anything where being wrong would cost real
work — halts immediately, without spending a retry. Halting is the correct outcome there, not a failure: report
and stop.

**Compile-heavy work goes to cloud workers.** Parallel builds and gate runs are what hurt on this machine, so
dispatch them as agents with `isolation: "remote"` rather than running them all locally. A remote worker checks
out from GitHub and cannot see the local tree, so the orchestrator COMMITS AND PUSHES to
`IServiceManifest-repair` before dispatching one, and the worker's work is against that pushed commit. Committing
and pushing freely to enable this is authorized. If remote isolation is unavailable at run time, fall back to
local workers rather than skipping the verification.

**Where the work happens (owner ruling 2026-08-19: directly in #274).** The run works FORWARD on
`IServiceManifest-repair` in the main checkout — no lift, no reset, no PR-back ceremony. First action: if the
working tree is dirty, commit it as-is (`--no-verify` savepoint); then fix forward. Worktrees are used ONLY
where they buy something concrete — a lane running concurrently with another (two agents cannot share one
working tree) or a change kept apart because integrating it early would cost more conflict-resolution than it
saves. A worktree lane merges back into `IServiceManifest-repair` the moment it lands; pushing the branch (and
lane branches, which is what feeds the cloud workers) is authorized throughout.

Changes the run is unsure about still go to their OWN separate worktrees, unmerged, reported by branch name.

**Out of scope: `refactor-toolkit-platform`** (owner ruling 2026-08-20). The toolkit-reorg branch stays held —
its npm packages are unpublished placeholders, publishing is the owner's job, and the run neither merges nor
deletes it. Leave the branch and its worktree alone.

The tree does not build or even format — much of it landed with `--no-verify`. One known break:
`tests/diagnostics.test/test/listener-config-factory.test.ts:75` has a stray `Manifest<any>` pasted ahead of a
`let manifest: Manifest = new DefaultManifest();`. Others are expected; finding and fixing them is the job.

**Order.** Apply every requirement in this doc, then work through whatever build errors remain.

Permitted with no discussion:

- typos;
- code that was never converted to the patterns this doc describes.

Not permitted:

- design decisions;
- code that does not comply with a pattern already established here or in the codebase.

**Vestigial code: delete aggressively — JUST DON'T BE WRONG** (owner order 2026-08-19). Dead helpers, orphaned
imports, retired mechanisms, commented-out corpses: remove on sight, no hedging, no "kept for reference".
The bar for "vestigial" is PROOF, not vibes — verify nothing reaches it (references, re-exports, white-box
seams, rhombus-std.json entries, tests) before the delete; a wrong delete costs more than ten kept corpses.
Where reachability is genuinely uncertain, that's a not-vestigial verdict, not a smaller delete.

Those two lists are the INTENT, not an exhaustive catalogue of what will come up. Where a situation is not covered,
read for the intent — the owner is not available to arbitrate mid-run, and a change that needs arbitration is by
definition one of the two forbidden kinds.

**Where the work lands.** Everything that satisfies the rules above is committed directly to
`IServiceManifest-repair` (#274) — serial work in the main checkout, worktree lanes merged in as they land. A
change the run is fairly confident about but cannot guarantee against those rules stays in an UNMERGED
worktree, one per such change, reported by branch name at the end.

**Milestone.** There must EXIST a revision on `IServiceManifest-repair` with every item in this doc done, nothing
half-applied, and the gates green — reached before the first async/scope commit, so it stays reachable afterwards.
It is a commit to produce, not a checkpoint to stop at: nothing waits for review there, and the run continues
straight through it.

**The async/scope gate — and its total independence from everything above.** `docs/async-scope.md` is expected to
exist by the run. Whether it exists, what it says, and whether it is blessed change NOTHING about how this doc is
executed: the work above runs to completion either way, in the same order, to the same standard. Do not check for
the file first, do not let its absence shorten the run, do not let its presence pull work forward. Look at it only
once everything above is done.

Implementation of anything in it is then released by ONE thing: the document saying, in those letters, that it has
been **blessed** by the owner. No synonym releases it — "signed off", "these requirements are finished and ready",
"approved", "final" and every other phrasing leave it unimplementable. Read closely for WHAT was blessed: the
blessing may cover only a portion of the document, and only that portion is released. Absent the word, the run
simply ends where the tasklist ended — report that async/scope was not released, and stop. That is a normal
ending, not a failure, and it takes nothing away from the work above.

## Execution plan — optimize HARD for ASAP

Parallel lanes from t=0. Merge conflicts are NOT globally avoided: a conflict that is mechanically easy to
resolve (rename-vs-rewrite on different lines, package.json/tsconfig JSON maps, disjoint-file churn) is CHEAPER
than the serialization that would prevent it — let it happen and resolve at integration. Serialize only where
edits are design-coupled (two lanes rewriting the same member's shape). Every lane commits early and often to
its own branch; the integrator merges each lane the moment it lands, not in one big-bang at the end.

- **L1 — critical path (ONE agent, serial internally).** The di.core/di repattern core, in this order:
  (1) the #365 back-out in di.extras (restores builds — everything else profits immediately);
  (2) the type-door collapse into asClass/asFactory; (3) ConstantType + addValue + the uniform `add`;
  (4) the `describe` chain + its inline entry; (5) U6's builder.ts + ServiceProvider.ts legs (they land last
  because the door collapse deletes most of them). L1 authors all new code ALREADY in the target naming
  (`serviceType`, `ServiceType`, no "token") so the L4 rename sweep never has to touch its output.
- **L2 — Go engine (parallel).** transforms/: aliased-union naming with the exportedness gate, AliasType
  derivation + node + factory (the primitives/Type.ts edits ride here — different files from L1),
  `Hole`→`Generic` rename, mergesynth ctor/func split. Parity e2es updated per change. Touches L1 only at the
  parity suites — integrate freely.
- **L3 — options family (prep now, core gated).** Immediately: the extras dep edges, the addOptions face fix,
  hosting's tsconfig.ci.json fix. The sentinel-slot rewrite + Keyed acceptance start the moment L1(3) and L2's
  Keyed derivation land — do not wait for L1 to finish entirely.
- **L4 — mechanical sweeps (parallel, file-scoped agents).** getOrInsert swap, groupBy, lazy-thrown strings,
  assertNever style, iterable `replace` overloads, smoke.ts audit/port, `configureContainer` degeneralization,
  errors-demo reimplementation, and the token→type + serviceType renames over every file OUTSIDE L1's blast
  radius (di.core/src/builder.ts, ServiceProvider.ts, the descriptor augmentation files). After L1 lands, one
  cheap re-sweep over its files for any straggler naming.
- **L5 — exports rework (parallel worktree).** The conventional-exports overhaul + the feat-src-first-exports
  salvage-check-and-delete. Its conflicts with other lanes are package.json/tsconfig JSON — easy merges,
  tolerated. Integrates LAST before the final gate so resolution-behavior changes are verified once, not per
  lane.
- **L6 — integrate & finish (serial tail).** Merge lanes as they complete; full gate; the comment sweep over
  the final diff (pure churn — never runs concurrently with code lanes); commit relabeling; milestone commit
  directly on `IServiceManifest-repair`; only then the async/scope gate check. L1 and this tail run in the main
  checkout on the branch itself; only the concurrent lanes (L2/L4/L5) take worktrees, per the ruling above.

Cloud workers carry gate runs and any lane whose file set is disjoint from the local tree state, per the
remote-worker rules above.

## Finish converting `Type | string` away (U6)

A parameter that names a type takes a `Type` and nothing else; a consumer holding a string writes `Type.from(...)`
at the call. Most sites are already converted by hand. What remains:

- [ ] **A parameter naming the SERVICE type is spelled `serviceType`, not `type`.** Faces are done; the internals
      still name the service type `type`: `libraries/di.core/src/ServiceScope.ts:21,23`;
      `libraries/di.core/src/Errors.ts:44,46,86,90,105` (readonly `type` member);
      `libraries/di.core/src/service-type.ts:10` (`withKey`);
      `libraries/di/src/internal/Engine.ts:37,46,63,105,114`; `libraries/di/src/internal/CallSite/CallSite.ts:114`;
      `ToCallSiteVisitor.ts:40,71,191,211,246`; `libraries/di/src/internal/ServiceScope.ts:69,73`. Several of these
      files carry uncommitted owner edits — re-verify lines before editing.

**Exempt — leave alone:** `libraries/primitives/src/Type/Type.ts` `:162` (`Signatures.from`) and `:265`. These
are the `from`-family boundary converters — the data-input surfaces where a string is legitimately accepted and
turned into a node — so they keep their string legs. The re-sweep must not flag them.

## Kill the sentinel slots

`libraries/options.augmentations/src/option-types.ts` fabricates global type names and registers values under them
that have no relationship to the name. `add(startupValidationTargetType(), optionsAddressType(type))` declares a
service type nothing in the program is ever of, and stores a `Type` node under it. Every one of these is a bucket
key wearing a type's clothes, with `[optionsType]` standing in for a composite key component rather than a type
argument.

- [ ] **Dissolve the `() => T` base-slot shape.**
      `libraries/logging.config/src/LoggingBuilder-Config-augmentations.ts:64` still registers
      `() => new LoggerFilterOptions()` — a class registration wearing a lambda. The base slot forcing a
      `() => T` where an ordinary class registration of the options type would do is the bizarro shape to
      dissolve — question the slot's whole shape while rewriting it, don't just preserve it.
- [ ] **`diagnostics.core` still fabricates package-qualified globals.**
      `libraries/diagnostics.core/src/types.ts:28,:44` (`METRICS_OPTIONS_TYPE` / `TRACING_OPTIONS_TYPE`,
      `Type.global(\`@rhombus-std/diagnostics/...\`)`) — convert to the real addresses`Type.imported('IOptions', '@rhombus-std/options', [...])` like the options family. A repo-wide
      sweep found no other instance.

## Authoring surface

- [ ] **Prefer inline `typefor<T>()` calls over `COMMON_EXPORTED_TYPES`-style shared Type consts.** Remaining:
      `libraries/di.core/src/resolver.ts:12` (`RESOLVER_TYPE`, 10+ consumers) and
      `libraries/diagnostics.core/src/types.ts:22-51` (8 exported `*_TYPE` consts) — both packages stage through
      ttsc so this is unblocked.

- [ ] **Sugar acceptance bar.** `options.augmentations/rollup.dts.mjs:14` does not list `di.extras` in externals
      — nothing leaks today; close the letter of the bar.

- [ ] **Collapse the type door into the implementer door — the sugar leg.** The primitive collapse landed; what's
      left is the one-argument-shorter sugar in `di.extras` deriving the implementer type, which doesn't exist
      anywhere yet:

      ```ts
      asClass<T extends Ctor>(this: …, ctor: T): … {
        return this.asClass(ctor, typefor<T>());
      }
      ```

- [ ] **`typefor<T>()` on a named type must type as the node it yields.** `TypeFor<T>` narrows only the two
      callable kinds and drops everything else to the full `Type` union, so `typefor<Type>()` types as `Type` when
      the value is an `ImportedType`. A named type argument types as its `ImportedType` (an ambient one as its
      `GlobalType`) — the fallback narrows to `NominalType`.

      An unnamed type argument is not an error: `typefor<{ host: string }>()` yields an `ObjectType`, the same
      structural node `schemaof` would build. Narrow no further than that — the named case is the only one a call
      site demands today, so everything else keeps falling back to `Type`.

A `Keyed<Type, K>` sketch demonstrating the shape — a real service type carrying a key, with a value genuinely
assignable to it, and the factory's own signature supplying its injection list:

```ts
export namespace ServiceManifestValidateOnStartAugmentations {
  const valKey = `@rhombus-std/options.augmentations/startup-validation-target`;

  export function validateOnStart(this: Manifest<string>, type: Type): Manifest<string> {
    return this
      // Accumulate the target in the flat startup-validation slot. This is the one slot holding the
      // composed `IOptions<T>` address rather than the bare `T` every other verb keys on, because
      // StartupValidator resolves each target and reads `.value` off it -- so the target has to be
      // resolvable.
      .add<Keyed<Type, typeof valKey>>(Type.imported('IOptions', '@rhombus-std/options', [type]))
      // One validator serves every target: its factory reads the whole target list off the resolver
      // at start time, not at registration.
      .tryAdd<IStartupValidator>(factory, typefor(factory));
  }

  function factory(resolver: IServiceProvider, startupType: Array<Keyed<Type, typeof valKey>>): IStartupValidator {
    return new StartupValidator(resolver, startupType);
  }
}
```

Three things it establishes: a fabricated global is replaceable by a real type plus a key; `Keyed<T, K>` in the
service-type position derives to the tag; and `typefor(factory)` supplies the whole injection list from the
factory's own parameters, so no hand-written `Type.func` or `RESOLVER_TYPE` is needed. The architecture for the
whole set is decided fresh when the slots above are rewritten, so this is a demonstration rather than the target.
(`AliasType` stays HELD per §191, owner re-confirmed 2026-08-21 — nothing from that thread is scheduled.)

## Inline discovery

- [ ] Issue #365, corrected scope (owner ruling 2026-08-21) — `registerInlineBodies` marker calls become a
      discovery channel **IN ADDITION TO** the `rhombus-std.json` publish list, which STAYS: not all inlinables
      are augmentations, so the JSON mechanism is not retired. A member may carry **multiple**
      `registerInlineBodies` calls, each supplying a DIFFERENT overload signature with its own implementation;
      the engine selects the body whose signature matches the checker's resolved overload at the call site. A
      rest-parameter body is one authoring choice among several — permitted where written, NEVER a requirement
      of the mechanism. Go side only.

- [ ] **The `*.extras` repattern, the TypeScript half of #365.** Once marker discovery lands, the augmentation
      sets' instance entries move out of `rhombus-std.json` and into per-overload `registerInlineBodies` calls
      (the JSON list stays for non-augmentation inlinables). The `getService` family keeps per-overload bodies —
      each registration carrying its own signature + implementation — not a single collapsed rest body. Blocked
      on the Go half landing first.

## Housekeeping

- [ ] **Audit every package's dependency categories — owner ruling needed.** The audit found
      `@rhombus-std/primitives` sitting as a plain `dependencies` entry (never `peerDependencies`) in roughly 35
      consumers including `di.core`, and `di` lists `di.core` as a plain dependency too — both contradict the
      stated identity-invariant rule that identity-load-bearing shared packages must be peers of their
      dependents. Either the rule is narrower than written or the tree is miscategorized — owner call.
- [ ] `libraries/di/src/augmentations/Manifest-ContainerBuilder-augmentations.ts` uses the retired
      `extends Flatten<typeof Ns>` shape, with its docs on the namespace rather than the face — convert to the
      canonical shape (one `declare module` block carrying the faces, docs on the face, `registerAugmentations`
      calls per overload group).
- [ ] `libraries/di/src/augmentations/ServiceProvider-resolution-augmentations.ts` is an empty stub — an empty
      `declare module` interface, `registerAugmentations({})`, and 4 unused imports. Dead scaffolding: delete it
      or fill it, per the vestigial rule — verify nothing imports it first.
- [ ] `tests/mergesynth.ttsc.e2e/test/mergesynth.test.ts:285` still describes `registerAugmentations`/`augment`'s
      parameter as `string | Type`; the parameter is `Type`-only now.
- [ ] **Replace the one remaining lazily-thrown string.**
      `libraries/di/src/internal/CallSite/ToCallSiteVisitor.ts:36` throws `` `wtf mate...` `` in
      `VisitDisposerFactory`'s `[Symbol.dispose]`, with no matching `catch` anywhere — it doesn't qualify for the
      intentional-control-flow exemption, so convert it to a real Error. The file carries uncommitted owner
      edits — re-verify the line before editing.
- [ ] **Conventional-commit labels on the owner's commits.** Unprefixed commits still on the branch ("i had to put
      this here to get the build to work...", "code-style -- no functional change", "these changes were left out
      from the previous commit by mistake", "overload definitions todo", "code style"); relabeling is now a
      history rewrite of the pushed branch — decide it together with the separate authorship question (all 69 run
      commits are authored `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`). SCOPING (agreed with the cloud2 session
      2026-08-21): this rewrite covers `de8cc99a` AND EARLIER only — cloud2's own run re-authors and
      force-pushes the post-`de8cc99a` segment itself — and executes only after pinging cloud2 (it holds the
      local checkout and a live branch monitor; tip movement must be sequenced so nothing is orphaned).
