// The scope frame + the resolution engine — the correctness core of the engine.
//
// Two complementary pieces:
//
//   `Scope` (frame) — a node in a parent-linked chain. Holds a name, a cache
//   of owned instances, a list for disposal ordering, and an optional parent
//   pointer. It does NOT hold registrations. There is no root frame: scopes are
//   uniform tags, and a `ServiceProvider` with no frame (the one `build()`
//   returns) resolves everything transiently until a scope is opened.
//
//   `ServiceProviderClass` — the concrete container impl behind the public
//   `ServiceProvider` interface (di.core). Implements `Resolver` (resolve +
//   resolveFactory) and `ScopeFactory` (createScope), plus native
//   `Disposable`/`AsyncDisposable`. Holds a sealed registration map (shared
//   across the tree) and an optional Scope frame.
//
// Resolution (§"The critical correctness rule"): on a cache miss the instance
// is constructed by resolving ITS constructor dependencies relative to the
// OWNING scope (the matched frame), never the scope that triggered the resolve.
// That is what keeps a long-lived service from silently capturing a shorter-lived
// one's cached instance — when no matching frame encloses the owner, the dep
// resolves transiently (a fresh instance) instead.
