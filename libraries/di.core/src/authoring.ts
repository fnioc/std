// The type-level authoring surface a LIBRARY AUTHOR depends on to type a
// registration setup function WITHOUT pulling the `@rhombus-std/di` runtime. Every
// export here is pure type-level machinery — it erases completely.
//
// A lib author writes a free function that contributes registrations to a
// caller-owned manifest:
//
//   import type { ServiceManifest } from "@rhombus-std/di.core";
//   export function addMyServices(sc: ServiceManifest<"singleton">): void {
//     sc.add("pkg:IThing", Thing, [["pkg:IDep"]]).as("singleton");
//   }
//
// The application supplies a real `@rhombus-std/di` `ServiceManifest` value; its class
// structurally satisfies the `ServiceManifestBase` interface below. Slots are
// authored as plain data literals typed by `DepSlot` — no runtime helper import
// is needed.
