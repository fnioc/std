 * the type derives the intrinsic provider token (`RESOLVER_TOKEN`), which the
 * engine resolves to the view relative to the resolving frame — "I want the
 * provider" is plain DI, no dedicated slot kind.
 *
 * `resolve` has two published shapes here; the tokenless authoring form
 * `resolve<T>()` (and the factory form `resolve<F>()`) is a PURE TYPING the
 * `@rhombus-std/di.transformer` DECLARATION-MERGES onto THIS interface (via
 * `declare module "@rhombus-std/di.core"`), so it lights up only when the
 * transformer is in the TypeScript program. Merging onto the interface (rather
 * than a separate carrier) is what lets both a factory parameter typed `Resolver`
 * AND the `ServiceProvider` interface a consumer holds pick up the authored form
 * — an interface inherits a base interface's merged overloads; a class would not,
 * which is exactly why the public provider surface is this interface, not the
