// Type-only authoring surface contributed to `@rhombus-std/di` by the transformer.
//
// These generic, token-free forms (`add<I>(C)`, `add<I>(fn)`, `addValue<I>(v)`,
// `.as<"scope">()`, `resolve<T>()`) NEVER execute: the @rhombus-std/di.transformer
// rewrites every such call to its explicit-token / value-arg form before
// runtime. They are therefore PURE TYPINGS, and they live here rather than in
// di's published types so that the authoring surface lights up only when the
// transformer is in the TypeScript program. Without the transformer, these
// forms don't exist on di's surface — which is the truth at runtime tool-free,
// and which kills the "compiles but throws at runtime" footgun.
//
// This module must be reachable from @rhombus-std/di.transformer's published types entry
// (it is `import`ed for its side effect from `./index.ts`) so that a consumer
// referencing `@rhombus-std/di.transformer` pulls the augmentation into its program.

import type { Ctor, Func } from "@rhombus-toolkit/func";
// Side-effect type import: makes @rhombus-std/di a known module in this program so

// (extending the package's types) rather than an ambient module declaration.
// No symbols are imported — the import exists solely to anchor the augmentation.

// Re-export the authoring brand types so transformer consumers can use
// `Inject<T, "tok">`, the open-generics placeholders (`Hole<N, C>`, `$<N>`)

// directly. The overload-faithful `OverloadedParameters` / `OverloadedConstructorParameters`
// ride along too — they type a factory rest parameter so an overloaded ctor
// lowers to one dep signature per overload. A single import of
// `@rhombus-std/di.transformer` brings both the transformer plugin and these types into scope.
