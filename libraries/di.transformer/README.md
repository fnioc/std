# @rhombus-std/di.transformer

The build-time `ts-patch` transformer for `ioc`. It accesses the TypeScript `TypeChecker` API at compile time to automate the three tasks that would otherwise be tedious to hand-write:

1. **Token generation** — derives a stable string token from each TypeScript interface type.
2. **Dep extraction** — reads constructor parameter types and converts them to token arrays.
3. **Registration lowering** — rewrites `services.add<IFoo>(Foo).as<"scope">()` to its plain-data runtime equivalent, emitting the derived dependency signature inline as the registration call's third argument (`add("token", Foo, [[...tokens]])`).

The result is the portable substrate: libraries compile once with the transformer and publish the lowered JS. Consumers without the transformer use that output directly.

---

## Setup

The transformer runs inside `ts-patch`'s patched `tsc`. It does not work with `ttypescript` (unmaintained).

### Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev @rhombus-std/di.transformer ts-patch
```

### Patch the compiler

```sh
npx ts-patch install
```

Run this once after installing `ts-patch`. It patches the local `typescript` installation so that the `plugins` array in `tsconfig.json` is honored at compile time.

### Wire into `tsconfig.json`

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      { "transform": "@rhombus-std/di.transformer" },
    ],
  },
}
```

### Use `tspc` in your build script

`ts-patch` ships `tspc` as a drop-in replacement for `tsc`. Use it in your `package.json` build script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tspc"
  }
}
```

`tsc` (unpatched) will ignore the `plugins` array. `tspc` processes it.

---

## Token derivation

Every named type produces a token `<source>:<exportName>` — `<source>` is where a human imports the type from, `<exportName>` its declared name.

| Parameter type                                  | Token emitted          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `IFoo` (package root export)                    | `"pkg:IFoo"`           |
| `IFoo` (package subpath export `pkg/contracts`) | `"pkg/contracts:IFoo"` |
| `IBar` (app-internal, package `app`)            | `"app/src/IBar:IBar"`  |
| `IBar` (app-internal, rootless project)         | `"./src/IBar:IBar"`    |

The transformer walks up to the nearest `package.json` to identify the owning package, then checks whether the symbol is publicly reachable.

### `Inject<T, K extends Token>` — per-arg token override

To pin a specific token for one constructor or factory parameter, use the `Inject` brand (re-exported from `@rhombus-std/di.transformer`, zero runtime):

```ts
import type { Inject } from "@rhombus-std/di.transformer";

class Handler {
  constructor(
    cache: Inject<ICache, "pkg:redis-cache">, // pinned token
    log: ILogger, // derived normally
  ) {}
}
```

Works in any type position the transformer reads: class ctor params, inline factory params, return types. The value type stays `T` — a plain `ICache` is assignable; the brand property is optional.

`Inject` is the escape hatch for anonymous or purely structural types — types without a name that the transformer cannot tokenize. Named types (including primitive keywords like `string`, `number`, `boolean`) always produce a token; `Inject` is not needed for them.

### `nameof<T>()`

The transformer provides a compile-time token helper. Each `nameof<IFoo>()` call in source is rewritten to the derived string token at build time — callers never ship the generation logic at runtime.

```ts
import { nameof } from "@rhombus-std/di.transformer";

const token = nameof<IUserRepo>();
// → "your-pkg/contracts:IUserRepo" at compile time
```

If the transformer is not wired up and `nameof` runs at runtime, it throws:

```
nameof<T>() requires the @rhombus-std/di.transformer plugin. Add { "transform":
"@rhombus-std/di.transformer" } to your tsconfig "plugins", or pass a token string.
```

This is intentional: un-transformed code fails loudly rather than silently returning `undefined`.

### Version skew caveat

Tokens do not embed the package version. Two compatible versions of the same package unify on the same token — the usual case. If two **incompatible** versions of a package are installed simultaneously, their tokens will collide, producing a registration conflict rather than two isolated containers. The mitigation is the same as for any peer dependency: keep compatible versions aligned. This is an acknowledged trade-off; version-embedded tokens would prevent legitimate version unification.

---

## Open generics

**Breaking change.** Before this release, type arguments were dropped during token derivation — `IFoo<A>` and `IFoo<B>` both tokenized to the same `pkg:IFoo` and silently collided. Generic type references now tokenize fully applied, recursively: `pkg:IFoo<pkg:A>` and `pkg:IFoo<pkg:B>` are distinct. Non-generic types are unaffected — zero change. (`@rhombus-std/di.transformer` ships this as `feat!`; `@rhombus-std/di.core` and `@rhombus-std/di` ship the open-generics substrate as additive `feat`s.)

TypeScript generics are erased — there is exactly one JS class per generic implementation — so "closing" a generic registration needs no runtime type machinery. It's token algebra: a closed token (`pkg:IFoo<pkg:User>`) is an ordinary, distinct cache key; an open template (`pkg:IFoo<$1>`) gets substituted at resolve time. See [`@rhombus-std/di`](../di/README.md#open-generics) for the resolution side.

### Closed-token grammar

Canonical, recursive: `base<arg1,arg2>` — no whitespace around the `<` `>` `,` separators (reserved characters, along with `$`, the hole sentinel). Each arg is itself a token, so nesting recurses:

```
pkg:IFoo<pkg:IBar<./src/Baz>>
```

- **Generic types always tokenize fully applied.** A bare mention of `IFoo` where `interface IFoo<T = string>` resolves via the checker to `IFoo<string>` and tokenizes closed: `pkg:IFoo<string>`. Type-parameter defaults arrive pre-applied — you don't need to write `IFoo<string>` explicitly.
- **`Promise<X>` tokenizes honestly, at every depth — there is no unwrap, anywhere.** A constructor parameter or factory return typed `Promise<IDb>` derives the token `Promise<pkg:IDb>`, distinct from `pkg:IDb`; this holds uniformly whether `Promise<X>` is the top-level dep type or nested inside a type argument (`IFoo<Promise<X>>` tokenizes as `pkg:IFoo<Promise<pkg:X>>`). See [`@rhombus-std/di`](../di/README.md#async-resolution) for how `resolve`/`resolveAsync` bridge a bare-`X` dependency to its `Promise<X>` registration.
- **Default-lib types tokenize by their bare name.** A type argument whose primary declaration lives in a TypeScript default-lib file (`Promise`, `Map`, …) tokenizes as the bare symbol name rather than an absolute path — `Promise<pkg:X>`, not a machine-dependent lib path.
- **Alias-wins is preserved.** `type UserRepo = IRepository<User>` tokenizes as the alias (`./src/UserRepo`), **not** the closed form `pkg:IRepository<pkg:User>` — consistent with the named-vs-inline union rule (see the wiki). This applies whenever the reference carries an alias symbol with no directly-applied type arguments of its own; loudly documented because it's easy to expect the opposite.

**v1 service-token restriction.** In a service token — the type argument to `add<...>()` or `resolve<...>()` — every type-arg position must be either **all holes** or **all concrete**. `IRepository<$<1>>` (open) and `IRepository<User>` (closed) are both valid; `IRepository<$<1>, User>` (mixed) is a compile error (990008, below). Dependency templates on the _impl_ side may mix holes and concrete args freely — `IMap<string, $<1>>` is a perfectly valid dep type.

### Placeholder / skolem authoring — `Hole<N, C>`, `$<N>`

Author an open registration by writing a hole in place of a type argument, both on the service token and the implementation:

```ts
import type { $ } from "@rhombus-std/di.transformer";

class SqlRepository<T> implements IRepository<T> {
  constructor(private db: IDbConnection) {}
}

services.add<IRepository<$<1>>>(SqlRepository<$<1>>);
```

`$<N>` is unbounded sugar for `Hole<N>` — a zero-runtime compile-time brand the transformer detects structurally (mirroring `Inject` brand detection), so it works whether referenced directly or through an alias. When the implementation's own type parameter carries a constraint, use `Hole<N, C>` directly so the skolem satisfies it:

```ts
class SqlRepository<T extends Entity> implements IRepository<T> {
  constructor(private db: IDbConnection) {}
}

services.add<IRepository<$<1>>>(SqlRepository<Hole<1, Entity>>);
// Hole<1, Entity> IS an Entity (constraint carrier `C`), so it satisfies
// `T extends Entity` where a bare `Hole<1>` ($<1>) would not typecheck.
```

A bare generic class reference with no type arguments, whose constructor parameters reference its own type parameters, is a compile error (990007, below) — supply an instantiation expression naming holes or concrete types.

### Instantiation expressions — closing (or holing) the impl side

The implementation side accepts a TypeScript instantiation expression (`Foo<...>` in value position, TS 4.7+) with either holes or concrete type arguments — including reordering and repeats:

```ts
class Pair<A, B> {
  constructor(readonly a: A, readonly b: B) {}
}

// Inverted order: the transformer reads the checker's INSTANTIATED
// construct-signature param types, so the substitution is already applied —
// param 0 (type A) is bound to $2, param 1 (type B) is bound to $1.
services.add<IPair<$<1>, $<2>>>(Pair<$<2>, $<1>>);

// Fully closed — no holes at all. Still generic-impl handling (registration-
// carried deps, below), because the ctor is still Pair, shared with every
// other Pair<...> registration.
services.add<IPair<User, Order>>(Pair<User, Order>);
```

The emitted value is the plain, un-parameterized ctor (`Pair`, type arguments stripped) — instantiation expressions only ever affect how the transformer _reads_ the checker, never what's emitted at runtime.

### `Typeof<T>` — the witness parameter

`Typeof<T>` is the `typeof(T)` analog: a constructor parameter of this type receives the **token string** the type argument `T` was bound to, letting an implementation introspect its own closing. It is type-driven — the transformer infers the hole from `T` — where the manual `typeArg(n)` names the hole positionally.

```ts
class SqlRepository<T> implements IRepository<T> {
  constructor(
    private db: IDbConnection,
    private entityToken: Typeof<T>,
  ) {}

  get category() {
    return this.entityToken;
  } // "pkg:User", "pkg:Order", …
}

services.add<IRepository<$<1>>>(SqlRepository<$<1>>);
```

For an **open** binding (`T` is a hole), the transformer emits a `{ typeArg: N }` slot that resolution substitutes per closing. For a **concrete** binding (a closed registration via an instantiation expression), the transformer emits the derived token directly as a literal value slot — no substitution needed, since the value is already known at compile time.

### Registration-carried dep signatures

Every registration's dependency signature — generic or not — rides directly on the registration as the **third argument to `add()`** (or `addFactory()`); there's no separate metadata call and nothing hoisted. Keying the signature on the registration record rather than the shared, erased ctor function is what lets one generic implementation back any number of independent closings or templates without collision:

```ts
// Author
services.add<IRepository<$<1>>>(SqlRepository<$<1>>);

// Lowered — the signature rides inline on the registration
services.add("pkg:IRepository<$1>", SqlRepository, [
  ["pkg:IDbConnection", { typeArg: 1 }],
]);
```

```ts
// Author — closed via instantiation expression
services.add<IRepository<User>>(SqlRepository<User>);

// Lowered — Typeof<T> binds concrete, so the slot is a literal value
services.add("pkg:IRepository<pkg:User>", SqlRepository, [
  ["pkg:IDbConnection", { value: "pkg:User" }],
]);
```

**Non-generic registrations use exactly the same mechanism** — see [What gets lowered](#what-gets-lowered) below for a plain (non-generic) example lowered the identical way. See [`@rhombus-std/di`](../di/README.md#open-generics) for how the runtime resolves and closes these against resolve-time type arguments.

---

## What gets lowered

For each `services.add<IFoo>(Foo).as<"scope">()` call the transformer finds, it:

1. Reads `Foo`'s constructor parameter types via the TypeChecker.
2. Derives a slot per parameter:
   - Interfaces, class types, named type aliases, and named built-ins (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `bigint`, `any`, `unknown`, `never`) → string token per the derivation rule above (named built-ins tokenize by keyword name). An unregistered token is a runtime miss, not a compile error.
   - `Promise<X>` → the honest token `Promise<...X>`, never unwrapped — see below.
   - **Inline function types** (`() => IFoo`, `(a: B) => IFoo`) → `{ type: "pkg:IFoo" }` (a `FactoryRef` — see factory detection below).
   - **Inline union types** (`A | B` written directly at the annotation site) → `{ union: ["pkg:A", "pkg:B"] }` (a `Union` slot — see named vs inline unions below).
   - **Anonymous inline structural types** (no name, no `Inject` brand) → **hard compile error** (990006 `UnderivableToken`): "name this type or brand it with `Inject<T, 'token'>`."
3. Emits the derived signature array inline as the registration call's third argument — no separate prelude call, nothing hoisted.
4. Rewrites the call from the type-driven form to the plain-data form.

```ts
// Author code
services.add<IUserRepo>(SqlUserRepo).as<"request">();
// SqlUserRepo constructor: (log: ILogger, db: IDbConnection, table: string)
// 'table' has type string → token "string" (runtime miss if "string" is unregistered)
// use Inject<string, "app:tableName"> to pin a custom token, or supply a registration override

// Lowered output (with table branded as Inject<string, "app:tableName">)
services.add("pkg:IUserRepo", SqlUserRepo, [
  ["pkg:ILogger", "pkg:IDbConnection", "app:tableName"],
]).as("request");
```

For a class with a single constructor, the transformer emits exactly one signature. For a class with declared overloads, it emits one signature per bodyless overload declaration in order — the implementation signature is ignored (it is not caller-visible).

### `Promise<X>` — the honest token split

A constructor parameter or factory return typed `Promise<IDb>` derives the token `Promise<pkg:IDb>` — Promise-ness is part of the type identity, never unwrapped away, at any depth. A bare `IDb`-typed dep and a `Promise<IDb>`-typed dep are therefore two distinct tokens with two distinct registrations. See [`@rhombus-std/di`](../di/README.md#async-resolution) for how `resolve` / `resolveAsync` bridge the two — a bare-`IDb` dependency can still be satisfied through its `Promise<IDb>` registration, but only via `resolveAsync`.

---

## Factory detection

A constructor parameter whose type annotation is an **inline function-type literal** (`ts.FunctionTypeNode`) is detected as a factory and emitted as `{ type: "<token>" }` in the registration's inline signature array. The token is derived from the return type honestly — a `Promise<X>` return is **not** unwrapped, so an async factory type keys on the `Promise<X>` token, not `X`. An optional `params` field lists the inline factory's caller-supplied parameter tokens in authored order.

```ts
// Inline function-type annotation → factory ref keyed on "pkg:IDb"
constructor(makeDb: () => IDb) { ... }

// Async inline function-type → factory ref keyed on "Promise<pkg:IDb>", not "pkg:IDb"
constructor(makeDb: (id: string) => Promise<IDb>) { ... }

// Named type reference → normal token "pkg:IDbFactory", NOT a factory
interface IDbFactory { (): IDb }
constructor(makeDb: IDbFactory) { ... }
```

Detection is **purely syntactic** — it reads the annotation node kind, not the resolved `ts.Type`. This is intentional: an inline arrow type and a named callable interface are structurally identical once resolved; only the syntax tells them apart. The named-interface form is the deliberate opt-out.

### Emitted form

```ts
// Author code
class RequestHandler {
  constructor(
    private log: ILogger, // resolved dep
    private makeDb: () => IDb, // factory-injected, zero caller args
  ) {}
}

// Lowered output — the signature rides on the registration itself
services.add("pkg:RequestHandler", RequestHandler, [
  ["pkg:ILogger", { type: "pkg:IDb" }],
]);
```

With caller-supplied params:

```ts
// Author code
class RequestHandler {
  constructor(
    private log: ILogger,
    private makeRepo: (tableName: string) => IUserRepo,
  ) {}
}

// Lowered output — params lists the caller-supplied token(s)
services.add("pkg:RequestHandler", RequestHandler, [
  ["pkg:ILogger", { type: "pkg:IUserRepo", params: ["app:tableName"] }],
]);
```

---

## Named vs inline unions

Detection is **purely syntactic** — the shape of the annotation node, not the resolved type.

| Annotation form                                      | Lowered slot           | What to register                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `constructor(x: A \| B)` — inline                    | `Union` — alternatives | any or all of A, B (first registered wins) |
| `type AB = A \| B; constructor(x: AB)` — named alias | single token for `AB`  | `AB` itself                                |

```ts
// Inline union → Union slot, try IRedis first then IMemoryCache
class Handler {
  constructor(cache: IRedis | IMemoryCache, log: ILogger) {}
}
// Lowered: { union: ["pkg:IRedis", "pkg:IMemoryCache"] }

// Named alias → single "pkg:CacheProvider" token
type CacheProvider = IRedis | IMemoryCache;
class Handler {
  constructor(cache: CacheProvider, log: ILogger) {}
}
// Lowered: "pkg:CacheProvider"
```

Registering `IRedis` or `IMemoryCache` separately does nothing for a `CacheProvider`-typed parameter — you must register `CacheProvider`. See the wiki for the full named-vs-inline treatment.

---

## Manual escape hatch

There's no annotation that makes the transformer skip a class, because there's nothing left to opt out of centrally — a signature lives on the registration that emits it, not on the class. The transformer only ever rewrites the **type-driven** authoring forms (`add<I>(...)`, `addValue<I>(...)`, the per-scope `add${Scope}<I>(...)` methods, `.as<"x">()`). Write the already-lowered, explicit-token form directly — `add("my:token", MyClass, [[...]])` — and the transformer leaves the call alone: it only matches a registration call whose value argument is a type-driven expression, never one whose first argument is already a string literal.

---

## Fully-dynamic classes

If the transformer cannot statically inspect a constructor (a class reference passed through a variable, a dynamically-constructed class), it emits no signature array — the registration lowers with just its required `token`/`ctor` arguments. At resolve time, `@rhombus-std/di` throws with guidance if the constructor has parameters but no signature on its registration:

```
No dep metadata found for <ClassName> (resolving "<token>"). The
constructor has parameters but no dep signature was found on its
registration. Pass the signature as the third add argument
(add(token, ctor, [[...]])), compile with @rhombus-std/di.transformer, or
register it with a factory.
```

A genuine zero-argument constructor is `new`ed directly without a dep lookup.

---

## Diagnostics

The transformer emits warnings during `tsc`/`tspc` for several classes of statically-detectable misconfigurations. Each diagnostic is anchored at the relevant node in the source file. All checks are conservative — they fire only where a mismatch is statically certain, never on a guess.

### Factory-signature mismatch (code 990003)

When the transformer can see the concrete class behind a factory-typed parameter, it compares the factory's declared call signature against the target constructor's caller-supplied parameters in order. If the counts don't match, it warns:

```
Factory parameter "makeRepo" takes 2 argument(s), but the factory caller
must supply 1 — the caller-supplied parameter(s) of the produced type's
constructor. List exactly those, in order.
```

This is the primary value-add of running the transformer: compile-time feedback when a factory's declared arity doesn't match what the container will actually expose at runtime.

### Underivable token (code 990006)

A constructor or factory parameter whose type is an anonymous inline structural type — no name, no `Inject<T, "tok">` brand:

```
cannot derive a token for this type — name the type or brand the parameter
with `Inject<T, 'my:token'>`
```

This is a hard compile error. Named types (interfaces, classes, type aliases, primitive keywords) always produce a token and never trigger this diagnostic. The fix is to either define a named type or brand the parameter with `Inject<T, "my:token">`.

An `@rhombus-std/di.eslint-plugin` that surfaces these diagnostics in-editor is planned for a future release.

### Unbound type parameter (code 990007)

A bare generic class reference with no type arguments (open or concrete) whose constructor parameters reference its own type parameters — the transformer can't derive a token for an unbound `T`:

```
this parameter references an unbound type parameter — register the class via
an instantiation expression that binds it (`add<IFoo<$<1>>>(Foo<$<1>>)` for an
open template, or `Foo<Concrete>` for a closed one)
```

Fix: write an instantiation expression on the implementation, e.g. `SqlRepository<$<1>>` (open) or `SqlRepository<User>` (closed).

### Mixed service-token arguments (code 990008)

A service token's type arguments mix holes and concrete types — v1 requires every position to be **all holes** or **all concrete**:

```
open service token "./app/IRepository<$1,./app/User>" mixes holes and concrete
type args — every type arg of an open service token must be a hole
(`IFoo<$<1>,$<2>>`); close the token fully or open it fully
```

Fix: split into a fully-open registration (`IRepository<$<1>, $<2>>`) or a fully-closed one (`IRepository<User, Order>`).

### Open token on value or factory registration (code 990009)

`addValue`/`addFactory` targeting an open service token — there is no single value or factory that can serve every closing:

```
open template token "./app/IRepository<$1>" on addValue — open registrations
are class registrations only; register a class implementation or close the
token
```

Fix: use a class registration (`add<IRepository<$<1>>>(SqlRepository<$<1>>)`), or register each closing separately under a concrete token.

### Dependency hole not in service template (code 990010)

A constructor parameter's dep type references a hole (`$N`) that doesn't appear anywhere in the service token's own template — the hole has nothing to bind to at close time:

```
dependency hole(s) $2 are not bound by the service token
"./app/IRepository<$1>" — every hole a dependency references must appear in
the service token's type arguments
```

Fix: add the missing hole to the service token, or replace the dependency's reference with a concrete type.

---

## Plugin-less consumers

The transformer is not required to _use_ `@rhombus-std/di`. It automates annotation for classes you own. When you don't have the transformer configured:

- Libraries compiled with the transformer publish plain-data lowered JS — their registrations work without any plugin on the consumer side.
- For your own classes, use `addFactory`/`addValue`, or hand-write the registration's own signature array (`add(token, ctor, [[...]])`). See [`@rhombus-std/di`](../di/README.md) and [`@rhombus-std/di.core`](../di.core/README.md) for those APIs.
